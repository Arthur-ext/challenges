# About the challenge

Imagine that a user need to know your latitude and longitude but, the unique things that knows is the address name, number, city, state and country.

### Thinking in it

1. How you will solve it? Fell free to use any programming language or technology and external services.
2. The user can do it a lot of times so, guarantee a fast response time would be cool.
3. Think, if the service that you use to get lat long goes down, how to keep delivering the recent queries that the user did.
4. Would be cool if the user can save your favorite locations about addresses queried.
5. Internally we would want a graphic to look quantity of requests per days and other metrics that you think to could important.
